# zoom_intigration
This POC is an example of procidure of integrating zoom apis to any project. This POC includes the following:
  1) zoom user authentication
  2) zoom creating meeting
  3) zoom chat

This POC uses apis provided by zoom. Paid accounts provide more functionality to these api (eg add more user to the app). Before using zoom apis, we need to create 
a app on zoom market (https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/apps) and use the client id of that app for authentication.
